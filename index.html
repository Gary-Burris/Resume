    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I taught myself Basic and C programming languages in high school and kept up with Basic <br>
        until VB6. I dabbled in robotics as a hobby throughout my life.  I enjoy a good game of <br>
        pool and travel.  I make friends easily although I enjoy my time in front of a computer.<br>
        And I'm a wonderful cook.
    </p>
    <p>
        As far as working goes, I've worked solo jobs most of my career but I'm a team player. As<br>
        someone used to working alone, I am a self-starter and able to complete tasks on my own. I<br>
        am also good working with customers either in person or over the phone.
    </p>
